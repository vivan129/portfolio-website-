          <p>
           At the age of 12, while in 7th grade, I designed and built a Fire-Fighting Drone — an innovative 
            solution aimed at combating wildfires efficiently. This custom-built drone is powered by six high-speed 
            BLDC motors and six propellers, ensuring stable flight and high agility. The core of the drone is its 
            flight controller, which processes real-time data to maintain balance and navigation. Fueled by a 12V battery,
            the drone boasts extended operational time, crucial for emergency response. What sets this drone apart is the
            fireball-dropping mechanism — a system that releases specialized fire-extinguishing balls directly onto flames,
            tackling hard-to-reach forest fires. Encased in a durable drone frame, this creation merges technology and innovation,
            reflecting my passion for robotics and problem-solving. This project wasn’t just about building a machine — it was about
            crafting a solution to a real-world crisis, driven by a desire to make a meaningful impact.

        <h3>Electric Go-Kart</h3>
        <p>Click for more</p>
        <div id="kart-details" class="project-details">
          <p>
        At the age of 13, as an 8th grader, I embarked on an ambitious journey to design and build my very own Electric Go-Kart — a high-performance racing machine capable of reaching speeds up to 120 km/h. Every aspect of this project was a reflection of my passion for engineering and innovation. I personally designed and fabricated the entire chassis from scratch, adopting a shifter kart design for maximum agility and speed. The heart of the go-kart lies in its 2kW motor, powered by a 60V battery setup — a combination that delivers both power and endurance on the track.
        Steering precision was achieved using an Ackermann geometry steering system, ensuring optimal handling during high-speed maneuvers. For safety and control, I installed a hydraulic disc brake system, paired with a rear axle chain drive assembly to efficiently transfer motor power to the wheels.                  
        Building this go-kart wasn’t just about assembling parts — it was about overcoming challenges. Working from Ludhiana, I faced numerous hurdles due to limited access to high-end components and resources. Yet, with relentless determination and creative problem-solving, I brought this project to life over the course of five intense months.              
        This electric go-kart represents more than just a vehicle — it’s a symbol of innovation, resilience, and the sheer thrill of turning an idea into reality. It fueled my drive to push technological boundaries and create solutions that merge speed, design, and engineering excellence.

        <h3>Human Size Robot</h3>
        <p>Click for more</p>
        <div id="coming-soon" class="project-details">
          <p>I have built a human-sized autonomous robot that can navigate indoors and outdoors, talk to people, and perform practical tasks
            like fetching items, helping in the house, and even gardening. The robot runs on a dual-brain system, with a main brain handling
            high-level decision making, speech, and navigation algorithms, while a secondary brain using a Raspberry Pi processes sensor data
            and manages precise motor control. A LIDAR sensor gives it 360-degree mapping ability, allowing it to move safely, avoid obstacles,
            and adapt to new environments using SLAM. It is equipped with speech recognition and AI-powered voice synthesis, enabling natural
            conversations and polite interactions with strangers. For gardening, it can water plants, monitor soil conditions, and reduce human effort.
            Building it at the age of 14 required me to solve challenges like synchronizing multiple systems, managing stability, integrating voice with 
            movement, and optimizing energy use. What makes it unique is not just its size but its ability to act as both a functional assistant and a 
            social companion, showing how robotics can combine engineering, AI, and creativity to improve everyday life.</p>
